      <description>Environment Unity 2021.3.16f1&#xA;Universal Render Pipeline 12.0.0&#xA;Introduction I recently finished The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. To me as an indie game developer, it felt like a text book of open world game design. I had a lot of fun playing it and I learned a lot from it.&#xA;One of the things I noticed is the rain drop effect that react to the uppper edges of the scene.</description>

      <description>Introduction In the previous post, I introduced the Xiheframework and its core modules. In this post, I will show you how to use it in your project and how to create your own modules in detail.&#xA;Import Xiheframework Via Git Submodule The recommended way to import Xiheframework is to use Git Submodule. This way, you can easily update Xiheframework to the latest version.&#xA;To do that:&#xA;Run the following command from the root of your Unity project folder to add Xiheframework as a submodule.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I will be discussing how I implemented a Screen-door transparency effect in Unity using URP 12. This effect is used to simulate the look of a transparent object by applying Bayer Ordered Dithering to the semi-transparent object. This effect can be used in games to give the player a better view of the character even when the character is coverd by obstacles.&#xA;How it works You can think of this effect as using a sharp pencil to poke a dense grid of holes onto a paper to reveal the objects behind the paper.</description>

      <description>What is XiheFramework XiheFramework is a game framework for agile development, wrote on top of Unity engine.&#xA;Who Should Use Scale Ideally at least two members:&#xA;Programmer for creating custom modules(game features) Technical designer for node editing Or use it as an individual developer (hair loss rate 200%)&#xA;Skills Unity Editor Node-based Editor C# (Custom Modules) Warning &amp;#x26a0;&amp;#xfe0f; Consider not to use this framework if you are work individually and have ZERO programming skill as you probably will have a lot of pain if you just use the node editor for all game logic.</description>
