      <description>Environment Unity 2021.3.16f1
Universal Render Pipeline 12.0.0
Introduction I recently finished The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. To me as an indie game developer, it felt like a text book of open world game design. I had a lot of fun playing it and I learned a lot from it.

      <description>Introduction In this post, I will be discussing how I implemented a Screen-door transparency effect in Unity using URP 12. This effect is used to simulate the look of a transparent object by applying Bayer Ordered Dithering to the semi-transparent object. This effect can be used in games to give the player a better view of the character even when the character is coverd by obstacles.
How it works You can think of this effect as using a sharp pencil to poke a dense grid of holes onto a paper to reveal the objects behind the paper.</description>
