      <description>Environment Unity 2021.3.16f1&#xA;URP 12.0&#xA;Prerequisite Basic knowledge of C# and Shader programming (HLSL).&#xA;GPU Instancing GPU instancing is a technique that allows you to draw multiple copies of the same mesh using a single draw call. It is basically normal forward rendering pipeline but skipping the Vertex Specification stage.&#xA;Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect The first step to create multiple millions of grass is to properly call the GPU to draw so, a.k.a. draw call.</description>

      <description>Introduction In my last post I started learning Mozilla Hubs by creating a demo scene. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the avator system in Hubs.&#xA;Demo Here&amp;rsquo;s a demo avator I made during my study, you may use it as your own avator from this Link&#xA;Features It has following features:&#xA;Idle animation Head tracking Lip syncing (User audio input feedback) Personal space invader (other avators will be transparent or disappear when the user is too close to them) It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have:</description>

      <description>Introduction Mozilla Hubs is a open-source browser-based metaverse web application that supports XR. The first thing to keep in mind is that it&amp;rsquo;s component-based like Unity. In the official build, Hubs supports various but very limited components such as model renderer, images renderer, videos renderer, audio field, etc. Although what creators could do in Hubs is very limited by the default build, I could imagine it&amp;rsquo;s bright future for two reasons:</description>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I will introduce a script I wrote for Toon-Boom Harmony that can be used to fill empty timeline cells with a placeholder drawing named &amp;ldquo;00&amp;rdquo; in order to save lots of time for animators. This is my first time writing a script for Harmony 20, so along with the script, I will also talk about what I learnt about the scripting module of Harmony from the past few days and some of the challenges I encountered.</description>

      <description>Environment Unity 2021.3.16f1&#xA;Universal Render Pipeline 12.0.0&#xA;Introduction I recently finished The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. To me as an indie game developer, it felt like a text book of open world game design. I had a lot of fun playing it and I learned a lot from it.&#xA;One of the things I noticed is the rain drop effect that react to the uppper edges of the scene.</description>

      <guid>https://www.yaotian-huang.com/tutorial/layer-based-screen-door-transparency-effect-using-unity-urp-12/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this post, I will be discussing how I implemented a Screen-door transparency effect in Unity using URP 12. This effect is used to simulate the look of a transparent object by applying Bayer Ordered Dithering to the semi-transparent object. This effect can be used in games to give the player a better view of the character even when the character is coverd by obstacles.&#xA;How it works You can think of this effect as using a sharp pencil to poke a dense grid of holes onto a paper to reveal the objects behind the paper.</description>

      <description>View the full project here: Github Repo&#xA;Introduction In a recent academic project, I implemented a secured web information system using Java Servlet and created several content pages including AboutMe, Skills, and Contact pages for testing my system.&#xA;The goal was to implement a web application that could allow users to login, logout and view their profile. The application also had to be secured against unauthorized access such as directly typing the content page URL.</description>

      <description>What is XiheFramework XiheFramework is a game framework for agile development, wrote on top of Unity engine.&#xA;Who Should Use Scale Ideally at least two members:&#xA;Programmer for creating custom modules(game features) Technical designer for node editing Or use it as an individual developer (hair loss rate 200%)&#xA;Skills Unity Editor Node-based Editor C# (Custom Modules) Warning &amp;#x26a0;&amp;#xfe0f; Consider not to use this framework if you are work individually and have ZERO programming skill as you probably will have a lot of pain if you just use the node editor for all game logic.</description>
