      <description>Environment Unity 2021.3.16f1
Universal Render Pipeline 12.0.0
Introduction I recently finished The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. To me as an indie game developer, it felt like a text book of open world game design. I had a lot of fun playing it and I learned a lot from it.
One of the things I noticed is the rain drop effect that react to the uppper edges of the scene.</description>

      <description>What is XiheFramework XiheFramework is a game framework for agile development, wrote on top of Unity engine.
Who Should Use Scale Ideally at least two members:
Programmer for creating custom modules(game features) Technical designer for node editing Or use it as an individual developer (hair loss rate 200%)
Skills Unity Editor Node-based Editor C# (Custom Modules) Warning ⚠️ Consider not to use this framework if you are work individually and have ZERO programming skill as you probably will have a lot of pain if you just use the node editor for all game logic.</description>
