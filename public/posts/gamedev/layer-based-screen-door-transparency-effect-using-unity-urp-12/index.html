This effect is used to simulate the look of a transparent object by applying Bayer Ordered Dithering to the semi-transparent object. This effect can be used in games to give the player a better view of the character even when the character is coverd by obstacles.\nHow it works You can think of this effect as using a sharp pencil to poke a dense grid of holes onto a paper to reveal the objects behind the paper. Also you can use a Threshold value to control how transparent the object is, a.k.a, how density of the grid of holes.\nShader-wise speaking, the effect can be divided into following steps:\nPrepare a temporary texture to store the result of the effect. Render a character-layer-only color texture using a character layer filter. Render a character layer depth texture. Render a obstacle layer depth texture to be compared with the character depth to determine whether the character is covered by obstacles. Send these textures with the camera RenderTarget as an texture to the compute shader to let it draw the final result onto the temporary texture we created in step#1. (Optional) Resize the temporary texture to the size of the camera RenderTarget. Blit the temporary texture onto the camera RenderTarget. Demo Here’s a quick demo of the effect.\nAnother detailed explanation of the effect, showcasing how this effect reacts to different threshold values. From here, if you are fimiliar with the concept of render feature and render pass, and just want to see the ordered dithering part, you can skip to the #execute-method section. To see the final code, skip to here: #source-code\nEnvironment Unity 2021.3.16f1 URP 12.0.0 Implementation From Requirements The first thing to do before implementing anything for me in most development cases is to abstract requirements into a function and determine the inputs and outputs.\nIn this project, the requirements are:\nLayer-based. The user should be able to specify both the Character Layers to apply the Screen-door transparency effect on, and the layers to be used as the Obstacle Layers. Ordered Dithering algorithm. The user should be able to specify the Threshold of the dithering. Screen Space. Since the effect is layer-based, this effect should be applied in the Post-Processing Stage. Threshold. The user should be able to specify the threshold value for the Screen-door transparency effect to get the desired transparency effect. To Inputs From these requirements, we can determine that the inputs are:\nInput Type Character LayerMask LayerMask Obstacle LayerMask LayerMask Ordered Dithering Shader Compute Shader Threshold Value float Render Pass Event RenderPassEvent Put into a Setting class, we have:\n[System.Serializable] public class Settings { public ComputeShader computeShader; public LayerMask targetLayer; public LayerMask obstacleLayer; public RenderPassEvent renderPassEvent = RenderPassEvent.AfterRenderingTransparents; [Range(0, 1f)] public float ditheringThreshold = 0.5f; //For Debugging(Optional) public bool previewInSceneView = true; } Render Pass Structure Now to create a new C# class that inherits ScriptableRenderPass, including settings we just created.\nprivate class ScreenDoorRenderPass : ScriptableRenderPass { private Settings m_Settings; public ScreenDoorRenderPass(Settings settings) { m_Settings = settings; } public override void Configure(CommandBuffer cmd, RenderTextureDescriptor cameraTextureDescriptor) { //Configure render target and render texture } public override void Execute(ScriptableRenderContext context, ref RenderingData renderingData) { //Construct and execute command buffer } public override void FrameCleanup(CommandBuffer cmd) { //Release temporary textures } } Variables Inside of the render pass, we need to create a few variables to store the temporary render textures and render target handles.\nprivate RenderTargetHandle m_TempCameraOpaque; //camera color private RenderTexture m_TargetOpaqueTexture; //target layer color private RenderTexture m_TargetDepthTexture; //target layer depth private RenderTexture m_ObstacleDepthTexture; //obstacle layer depth Note: Don’t be scared by the type names. RenderTargetHandle, RenderTargetIdentifier, RenderTexture, etc. They all does the same thing: storing a texture.\nIn GPU, each texture is associated with a unique ID. RenderTargetHandle, RenderTargetIdentifier are just wrappers around the texture ID while RenderTexture is a wrapper around the texture itself.\nConfigure Method Now we can configure the render target and render texture in the Configure function.\npublic override void Configure(CommandBuffer cmd,RenderTextureDescriptor cameraTextureDescriptor) { var descriptor = cameraTextureDescriptor; descriptor.enableRandomWrite = true; cmd.GetTemporaryRT(m_TempCameraOpaque.id, descriptor); m_TargetOpaqueTexture = RenderTexture.GetTemporary(cameraTextureDescriptor.width, cameraTextureDescriptor.height, 0, RenderTextureFormat.ARGB32); m_TargetDepthTexture = RenderTexture.GetTemporary(cameraTextureDescriptor.width, cameraTextureDescriptor.height, 16, RenderTextureFormat.Depth); m_ObstacleDepthTexture = RenderTexture.GetTemporary(cameraTextureDescriptor.width, cameraTextureDescriptor.height, 16, RenderTextureFormat.Depth); } Frame Cleanup Method Finish the FrameCleanup function while we still remember.\npublic override void FrameCleanup(CommandBuffer cmd) { cmd.ReleaseTemporaryRT(m_TempCameraOpaque.id); RenderTexture.ReleaseTemporary(m_TargetOpaqueTexture); RenderTexture.ReleaseTemporary(m_TargetDepthTexture); RenderTexture.ReleaseTemporary(m_ObstacleDepthTexture); } Execute Method Finally, we can start to write the Execute function where the actual rendering logic locates. Since the code is relatively long, I will explain it in chunks.\n// Fetch a command buffer from the command pool, remember to release it at the end of the function CommandBuffer cmd = CommandBufferPool.Get(name: \"Screen Door Transparency\"); // Clear the command buffer in case there are some commands left cmd.Clear(); Command buffers are used to store GPU commands. We can think of it as a list of GPU commands.\nAfter fetching the command buffer, prepare the drawing settings for drawing opaque(colored) texture for Character layer(the layer that’s needed to be revealed from obstacles).\n// Prepare the drawwing setting for opaque texture (for character layer) var drawOpaqueSettings = CreateDrawingSettings(new ShaderTagId(\"UniversalForward\"), ref renderingData, SortingCriteria.BackToFront); // Prepare the drawing setting for depth-only mode var drawDepthSettings = CreateDrawingSettings(new ShaderTagId(\"DepthOnly\"), ref renderingData, renderingData.cameraData.defaultOpaqueSortFlags); // Prepare the filtering setting for character layer var targetFilter = new FilteringSettings(RenderQueueRange.all, m_Settings.targetLayer.value); // Prepare the filtering setting for obstacle layer var obstacleFilter = new FilteringSettings(RenderQueueRange.all, m_Settings.obstacleLayer.value); Now render all the textures using the settings we just created.\n//draw target opaque cmd.SetRenderTarget(m_TargetOpaqueTexture); cmd.ClearRenderTarget(true, true, Color.clear); context.ExecuteCommandBuffer(cmd); cmd.Clear(); context.DrawRenderers(renderingData.cullResults, ref drawOpaqueSettings, ref targetFilter); //draw target depth cmd.SetRenderTarget(m_TargetDepthTexture); cmd.ClearRenderTarget(true, false, Color.clear); context.ExecuteCommandBuffer(cmd); cmd.Clear(); context.DrawRenderers(renderingData.cullResults, ref drawDepthSettings, ref targetFilter); //draw obstacle depth cmd.SetRenderTarget(m_ObstacleDepthTexture); cmd.ClearRenderTarget(true, false, Color.clear); context.ExecuteCommandBuffer(cmd); cmd.Clear(); context.DrawRenderers(renderingData.cullResults, ref drawDepthSettings, ref obstacleFilter); //reset render target var cam = renderingData.cameraData.renderer; cmd.SetRenderTarget(cam.cameraColorTarget, cam.cameraDepthTarget); //cache camera color which will be used later in the compute shader as a source texture cmd.Blit(cam.cameraColorTarget, m_TempCameraOpaque.Identifier()); Note\nThe commands inside CommandBuffer won’t be executed before context.ExecuteCommandBuffer(cmd). Therefore context.ExecuteCommandBuffer(cmd) is needed before every context.DrawRenderers(...) to make sure the commands are executed before we draw any textures.\nAt this point, we have rendered all the textures we need. Now we can pass them to the compute shader:\n//get kernel var shader = m_Settings.computeShader; var mainKernel = shader.FindKernel(\"BayerOrderedDithering\"); //set textures and parameters cmd.SetComputeTextureParam(shader, mainKernel, \"_InputTexture\", cam.cameraColorTarget); cmd.SetComputeTextureParam(shader, mainKernel, \"_TargetOpaqueTexture\", m_TargetOpaqueTexture); cmd.SetComputeTextureParam(shader, mainKernel, \"_TargetDepthTexture\", m_TargetDepthTexture); cmd.SetComputeTextureParam(shader, mainKernel, \"_ObstacleDepthTexture\", m_ObstacleDepthTexture); cmd.SetComputeTextureParam(shader, mainKernel, \"_OutputTexture\", m_TempCameraOpaque.Identifier()); cmd.SetComputeFloatParam(shader, \"_DitherThreshold\", m_Settings.ditheringThreshold); //define thread group size int threadGroupX = Mathf.CeilToInt(renderingData.cameraData.camera.scaledPixelWidth / 8.0f); int threadGroupY = Mathf.CeilToInt(renderingData.cameraData.camera.scaledPixelHeight / 8.0f); //dispatch compute shader cmd.DispatchCompute(shader, mainKernel, threadGroupX, threadGroupY, 1); //draw the result back to screen cmd.Blit(m_TempCameraOpaque.id, cam.cameraColorTarget); The denominator when calculating the threadGroup sizes must match the numthreads attribute in the compute shader to get a full screen processing, in my compute shader it is set to [numthreads(8,8, 1)], there fore we divide the screen width and height by 8.\nAt this point, we have defined all the commands for the ComputeBuffer. Now we just need to execute it.\n//submit commands to the GPU context.ExecuteCommandBuffer(cmd); //release command buffer from RAM CommandBufferPool.Release(cmd); //might be unnecessary, unity will do this for us in the end of execute method, but just in case context.Submit(); Now we have finished our ScreenDoorRenderPass.\nRender Feature To use the render pass we just created, create a new C# class that inherits ScriptableRendererFeature.\nusing UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.Rendering; using UnityEngine.Rendering.Universal; public class ScreenDoorRenderFeature : ScriptableRendererFeature { [SerializeField] public Settings settings = new Settings(); ScreenDoorRenderPass m_RenderPass; public override void Create() { m_RenderPass = new ScreenDoorRenderPass(settings) { renderPassEvent = settings.renderPassEvent }; } public override void AddRenderPasses(ScriptableRenderer renderer, ref RenderingData renderingData) { if (settings.computeShader != null \u0026\u0026 settings.targetLayer != 0 \u0026\u0026 settings.obstacleLayer != 0) { renderer.EnqueuePass(m_RenderPass); } } } What’s going on here is relatively simple. We create a new ScreenDoorRenderPass and set its renderPassEvent to the one we defined in the inspector. Then we add the render pass to the renderer’s queue.\nAnd that’s it! Now we can use the render feature in our renderer settings.\nSource Code Source Code: Screen Door Transparency\nRenderer Asset Note The basic setup for an URP project is not part of the scope for this article. If you don’t know how to do that, please refer to this manual page: InstallURPIntoAProject.\nMake sure to enable opaque texture and depth texture in the URP asset.\nFind your URP renderer asset and add the render feature we just created.\nDrag the compute shader we create eariler in, and set the target layer to the ones you want to reveal from obstacles and as the name suggested , set all the environment layers as obstacle layer.\nFor example, in the video demo, the layer for the green boxes are set to be osbatcle layer, and the layer for the orange balls are set to be target layer.\nFuture Improvements Add a dropdown menu to the render feature to allow the user to select different sizes of Bayer Matrixes. Support Transparent objects. Optimize the performance of the render feature by reducing the size of the temporary textures. The current project I’m working on doesn’t require a object-based Screen Door Effect. But if you need it, you can just add a oredered dithering pass to the shader.

  <div class="post-content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>In this post, I will be discussing how I implemented a <strong>Screen-door transparency</strong> effect in Unity using <strong>URP 12</strong>. This effect is used to simulate the look of a transparent object by applying <strong>Bayer Ordered Dithering</strong> to the semi-transparent object. This effect can be used in games to give the player a better view of the character even when the character is coverd by obstacles.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-it-works">#</a></h2>
<p>You can think of this effect as using a sharp pencil to poke a dense grid of holes onto a paper to reveal the objects behind the paper. Also you can use a Threshold value to control how transparent the object is, a.k.a, how density of the grid of holes.</p>
<p>Shader-wise speaking, the effect can be divided into following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare a temporary texture to store the result of the effect.</li>
<li>Render a character-layer-only color texture using a character layer filter.</li>
<li>Render a character layer depth texture.</li>
<li>Render a obstacle layer depth texture to be compared with the character depth to determine whether the character is covered by obstacles.</li>
<li>Send these textures with the camera <strong>RenderTarget</strong> as an texture to the compute shader to let it draw the final result onto the temporary texture we created in step#1.</li>
<li><em><strong>(Optional)</strong></em> Resize the temporary texture to the size of the camera <strong>RenderTarget</strong>.</li>
<li>Blit the temporary texture onto the camera <strong>RenderTarget</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="demo">Demo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#demo">#</a></h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick demo of the effect.</p>

Another detailed explanation of the effect, showcasing how this effect reacts to different threshold values.

<p>From here, if you are fimiliar with the concept of render feature and render pass, and just want to see the ordered dithering part, you can skip to the <a href="#execute-method">#execute-method</a> section. To see the final code, skip to here: <a href="#source-code">#source-code</a></p>

<h3 id="from-requirements">From Requirements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#from-requirements">#</a></h3>
<p>The first thing to do before implementing anything for me in most development cases is to abstract requirements into a function and determine the inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>In this project, the requirements are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Layer-based. The user should be able to specify both the <strong>Character Layers</strong> to apply the Screen-door transparency effect on, and the layers to be used as the <strong>Obstacle Layers</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ordered Dithering</strong> algorithm. The user should be able to specify the <strong>Threshold</strong> of the dithering.</li>
<li><strong>Screen Space</strong>. Since the effect is layer-based, this effect should be applied in the <strong>Post-Processing Stage</strong>.</li>
<li>Threshold. The user should be able to specify the threshold value for the <strong>Screen-door transparency</strong> effect to get the desired transparency effect.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="to-inputs">To Inputs<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#to-inputs">#</a></h3>
<p>From these requirements, we can determine that the inputs are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Input</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Character LayerMask</td>
<td>LayerMask</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Obstacle LayerMask</td>
<td>LayerMask</td>

<tr>
<td>Ordered Dithering Shader</td>
<td>Compute Shader</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Threshold Value</td>
<td>float</td>

<td>RenderPassEvent</td>

</table>

<p><strong>Note</strong>
The basic setup for an URP project is not part of the scope for this article. If you don&rsquo;t know how to do that, please refer to this manual page: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@7.1/manual/InstallURPIntoAProject.html">InstallURPIntoAProject</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure to enable opaque texture and depth texture in the URP asset.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="asset-setting.png"/> 
</figure>

<p><br>
Find your URP renderer asset and add the render feature we just created.</p>
<p><figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="feature-setting.png"/> 
</figure>

Drag the compute shader we create eariler in, and set the target layer to the ones you want to reveal from obstacles and as the name suggested , set all the environment layers as obstacle layer.</p>
<p>For example, in the video <a href="#demo">demo</a>, the layer for the green boxes are set to be osbatcle layer, and the layer for the orange balls are set to be target layer.</p>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#future-improvements">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Add a dropdown menu to the render feature to allow the user to select different <strong>sizes</strong> of Bayer Matrixes.</li>
<li>Support Transparent objects.</li>
<li>Optimize the <strong>performance</strong> of the render feature by reducing the size of the temporary textures.</li>
<li>The current project I&rsquo;m working on doesn&rsquo;t require a <strong>object-based</strong> Screen Door Effect. But if you need it, you can just add a oredered dithering pass to the shader.</li>
