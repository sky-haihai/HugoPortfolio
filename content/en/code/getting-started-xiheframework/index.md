## Introduction

In the previous post, I introduced the Xiheframework and its core modules. In this post, I will show you how to use it in your project and how to create your own modules in detail.

## Import Xiheframework

### Via Git Submodule
The recommended way to import Xiheframework is to use Git Submodule. This way, you can easily update Xiheframework to the latest version.

To do that:

Run the following command from the root of your Unity project folder to add Xiheframework as a submodule.
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/sky-haihai/XiheFramework.git Assets/XiheFramework
```
Or if you are using a GUI Git client, you can also add the submodule via the client.

URL:
```
https://github.com/sky-haihai/XiheFramework.git
```

Local Relative Path:
```
Assets/XiheFramework
```
